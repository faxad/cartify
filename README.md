### Introduction
**Cartify** is designed to serve as a shell for the swift rollouts of e-Commerce web applications. The service-oriented design decouples the application logic from the core constructs such as data persistence, logging, error reporting, and payment gateway integration which provides developers with a clean API for customization.

Some of the core features include the ability to browse the list of products organized to highlight the key attributes namely category, price, reviews, rating etc. Detail of each product can be viewed along with associated user feedback. Customers can add/remove items to/from the shopping cart. Administrators can manage inventory by adding new items and revising attributes of the existing items.
